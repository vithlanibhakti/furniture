  <div>
    <p>When ordering , after choosing your furniture you will be asked to select your preferred method of payment from cheque.Upon our receipt of your payment, and the successful processing of your order, we will send you by post an order confirmation. This also serves as a receipt.</p>
<p>If you prefer to pay by cheque, please make your cheque payable to Retail Furniture and send by post to:</p>
<p>Online Office</p>
<p>Badgers Rise</p>
<p>Marston Gate</p>
<p>Ridgmont</p>
<p>MK43 0YL</p>
<p>A personal cheque may take up to 7 working days to clear before we can finalise the dispatch of your order.
Unfortunately it is not possible for payment to be collected by our delivery teams.</p>

																	 <h6>Q. Can I just pay a deposit?</h6>
																	 <div>
                                                                    <p>As product lead times may vary between 1 to 16 weeks (although the latter is generally an exception,) we have recently introduced some changes to our payment process to spread the costs for items with a longer anticipated delivery time. You may opt initially to pay a deposit which may be as low as 10% of your order value, with the final balance to be settled prior to delivery. (For certain ranges which are delivered direct to you from our suppliers, final payment may be required up to 14 days before installation, so as not to delay shipment.)</p>
																	</div>
																	
																	<h6>Q. How do I pay my balance?</h6>
																	<div>
																	<p>Generally payment is made 24 to 48 hours before we deliver. However on a selection of dining and cabinet furniture, which are delivered direct to you from our suppliers, monies may be required up to 14 days before installation, so as not to delay shipment. You can given payment in cash direct after the delivery of furniture product at nearest branch or showroom or payment by Demand Draft or Cheque also.</p></div></div>
