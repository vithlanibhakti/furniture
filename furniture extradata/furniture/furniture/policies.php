                                                                    <div><p>The following describes the Privacy Policy of Retail Furniture Industries, Inc. (referred to as “Ashley Furniture,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) for this Web site. We understand how important it is to keep your personal information confidential. We value the information you provide to us and want you to be confident that we are committed to protecting your privacy. Our commitment to protecting your privacy is outlined in the policies below.</p><p>This Privacy Policy was created to inform you of what information we collect when you visit our Web site retailfurniture.com. This policy addresses the nature, purpose, use, and sharing of any information collected via our Web site. The information you provide on our Web site will be used only for its intended purpose. Submitting personally identifiable information is strictly voluntary. By using this Web site, you acknowledge to us and our affiliates your agreement on the Terms of Use of this Web site. If you do not want to give us your permission to use your information, do not provide it. However, not providing certain information may result in our inability to provide you with the information or services you desire.</p></div>
																	<h6>Information Collected</h6>
                                                                    <div><p>The two types of information we collect are personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Non-personally identifiable information is anonymous information that cannot be used to identify you. We use this information to track navigation through a Web site, which pages are viewed most often, what other Web sites are visited, and similar data.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is sensitive information that can be used to identify you. Personally identifiable information includes, among other information, your name, e-mail address, physical mailing address, and telephone number. Some of the features on our Web site require that you provide us information about yourself. This information is collected only when you provide it to us by filling out a form on our Web site. You can review and update any personal information you have provided to us. When you provide us your personal information, you consent to the information practices described in this policy.</p>
<p>We will never request your password, user name, or other personally identifiable information through e-mail. This practice, called “phishing,” is oftentimes a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail message that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond.
</p></div>
																	<h6>Use of Information You Provide</h6>
                                                                    <div><p>If you choose to provide us with personal information, we will use that information to enhance your experience in the following ways:</p>
																	<p>•	Register you as a member of retailfurniture.com.</p>
<p>•	Customize your shopping experience.</p>
<p>•	Communicate great values and featured items to you.</p>
<p>•	Comply with valid legal procedures, requirements, regulations, and statutes.</p></div>

																	<h6>Interaction with Children</h6>
                                                                    <div><p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 on our Web site. You must be 18 years of age to use our Web site. Please see our Terms of Use.</p></div>
																	<h6>Automatically Collected Information</h6>
                                                                    <div><p>We save information based on your interaction with our Web site. This allows us to process your inquiries more efficiently, and ultimately, give you better customer service. This information includes, but is not limited to, your Internet Protocol address (the address automatically assigned to your computer every time you establish a connection to the Internet), the name of any referring Web sites, as well as your navigation and activity on our Web site. By tracking this type of information, we can modify our content and product displays to enhance your experience on our Web site.</p><p>This information is only used to help us make our Web site more useful to you. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are retained temporarily as required for security and site management purposes only.</p></div>
																	<h6>Information Collected for Tracking Purposes (Cookies)</h6>
                                                                    <div><p>Like many Web sites, we use “cookies” to obtain information when your web browser accesses our Web site. “Cookies” are small amounts of data that are stored on your computer and find their way to your browser via a Web server. They flag information about your activity on our Web site. This information helps us to improve our Web site and to make it friendlier and easier to use. We are then able to “recognize” you and personalize your experience with our Web site. However, cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Web site’s best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p><p>We may use third party service providers to serve advertisements and e-mail messages on our behalf. This form of marketing is called “retargeting;” and it enhances the web surfing experience. These companies may use technologies to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and use information about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites you visit so that we can provide a better experience for you. These third party service providers may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and your interaction with our Web site. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. Our third party service providers do not learn the name, telephone number, postal address, e-mail address, or any other personal information about you.</p></div>
																	<h6>Security</h6>
                                                                    <div><p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of the data you provide to us. Our servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data facilities to further increase security. While no computer is 100% safe from outside attacks, we believe that the steps we have taken to protect your personally identifiable information dramatically reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate for the type of data involved.</p></div>

This privacy policy is subject to change without notice. We may change our policy at any time by posting a new version of it on our Web site. Therefore you should review this privacy policy each time you visit our Web site.</p></div>
