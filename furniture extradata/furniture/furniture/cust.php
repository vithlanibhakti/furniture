Recliners manufactured after May 2002 already have the new safety enhancement.</p><p>Between 1912 and 1987, These Maid manufactured and sold an estimated 12 million cedar chests. Cedar chests made during these years latch shut without having to depress a button. In recent years, several children have suffocated inside chests with old style locks. As a result, These has launched several successful programs concentrating on lock replacemnt. However, there are still an estimated 6 million chests that need the locks replaced. Chests manufactured after 1987 already have the new safety lock.</p></div>
