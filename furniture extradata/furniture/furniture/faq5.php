                                                                    <h6>Q. What do I do if my furniture arrives damaged?</h6>
                                                                    <div><p>Naturally we endeavour to deliver all our furniture in good condition. At Retail Furniture we have spent many hours talking to our suppliers about packing and shipping our products so they arrive safely. We are constantly looking for ways to improve these standards. Our stores also pride themselves on having the best delivery teams in the business.</p>
<p>It is disappointing for you and us when occasionally things go wrong. When your order has been unwrapped in your home and there are signs of transit damage, you have the right to the following options:</p>
<p><b>Reject the goods</b></p>
<p>• You will be asked to complete an Incident Report form immediately, which will be provided by the home delivery team.</p>
<p>• The Incident Report form will then be returned to the delivering store. It will be logged against your order number and a refund of all monies paid, including any delivery charges, will be made as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of cancellation being accepted.</p>
<p>• The Incident Report form will then be returned to the delivering store. It will be logged against your order number and a refund of all monies paid, including any delivery charges, will be made as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of cancellation being accepted.</p>
<p><b>Keep the goods</b></p>
<p>• If the furniture is useable, despite the damage, we are happy for you to go ahead and use it.</p>
<p>• The Retail Furniture home delivery team will complete an incident report form (if appropriate) to record the problem. They will ask you to sign it and they may also take photographs to accompany the paperwork.</p>
<p>• The Incident Report form will then be returned to the delivering store. It will be logged against your order number, and assessed for necessary further action.</p>
<p>• Our Customer Care team will then contact you to arrange a technician to visit and repair the problem to manufacturing standards, generally within 7 days. If he/she is unable to resolve the matter on the first visit and parts are required, we will endeavour to source them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>• In the event that a repair cannot be made, we will replace the furniture, or give a full refund including any delivery charges (where applicable). The goods that are deemed faulty revert to the ownership of Retail Furniture, and must be in our possession before monies are refunded.</p></div>
																	 <h6>Q. What if I discover a fault with my furniture after delivery?</h6>
                                                                    <div><p>Faults that develop after 14 days of Delivery: In the unlikely event that one of our items is to develop a fault, please call us on our Customer Care line: 080- 40209600 or via our on-line branch or showroom to discuss the options. Your options may vary depending on the individual circumstances including the length of time that you have had the item and the nature of the fault.</p></div></div>
