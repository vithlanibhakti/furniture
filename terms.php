In the case where an order placed online contains a pricing error, you will be contacted and the order will be cancelled.

																	<h6>Warranties</h6>

<p>The basic warranty is void if the merchandise suffers damage caused by abuse, negligence or accident, has been relocated, repaired or tampered with, was sold "as is", or is used for commercial purposes. We do not guarantee fabrics against wear, fading, color fastness or any damage caused by cleaning processes.</p>

<p>Please note that many manufacturers offer separate warranties on their products. For more information, please refer to any warranty tags that come with the furniture.

																	<h6>Delivery</h6>
                                                                    <div><p>To ensure smooth delivery of your furniture, please review the following delivery policies:</p>

<p>•	COD's are not accepted on delivery.</p>
<p>•	All orders must be paid in full at the time of purchase but if any balance is due on your order, please make full payment at least seven (7) days before your scheduled delivery date, as we will otherwise need to reschedule your delivery.</p>
<p>•	Approximately two (2) days prior to your scheduled delivery date, we will attempt to contact you by phone to confirm an estimated four (4) hour time window for your delivery. Unfortunately, we cannot take requests for time stops.</p>
<p>•	If you must reschedule your delivery date, please notify our retail partner's Customer Service Department or our online Customer Support or email us at customerservice@retailfurniture.com at least three (3) days before your scheduled delivery.</p>
<p>•	In preparation for your merchandise delivery, doorways should be measured to ensure clearance and rooms cleared so there is an unobstructed path between the point of entry to your home and the room where your new merchandise will be placed.</p>
<p>•	Due to liability issues, we cannot hoist merchandise, set up lamps, hang pictures or mirrors on walls, make electrical connections or move existing furniture, electronics, televisions, etc.</p>
<p>•	Our delivery drivers can only deliver up to the 3rd floor without elevator; an additional charge will be applied for each additional flight of stairs climbed to make your delivery. Elevator time requirements or restrictions need to be called in to Online Customer Service Department at least 72 hours prior to delivery.</p>
<p>•	We cannot deliver to anyone under age 18.</p>
<p>•	Visible merchandise damage or any home damage must be noted on delivery documentation and called in to our Online Customer Service Department within 48 hours of delivery.</p></div>

<p>Once you place your order, you will receive the contact information of service representatives that will help you with your order.
