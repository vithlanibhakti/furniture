                                                          <div id="accordion"><h6>Q. Where do you deliver?</h6>
  <div>
    <p>
    Online we currently offer our Premier Delivery Service to customers and including all postcodes. If, however, you live somewhere which is more than 40 miles from our nearest store or distribution centre, we cannot guarantee that we will always deliver within the time quoted.
    </p>
	<p>For customers who live on the islands of Scotland and other off shore locations such as the Isle of Wight, additional delivery charges will apply. Please contact the online office for more details. You may complete your order via the website in the normal way. At the end of the process, however, you can choose to submit your details for a quotation, and we will call you back within 48 hours; or you may phone us direct. We can also process your order over the phone.</p>
  </div>
   <h6>Q. Will you assemble my furniture?</h6>
  <div>
    <p>
    For most items delivered via the Retail Furniture Premier Delivery Service, delivery and installation is included. To help you we try to indicate in the product text where self-assessment is required. If you wish to engage an independent fitting service we may be able to assist you. Any suggestions we make, however, are not for companies directly linked to Retail Furniture. You may wish to employ a tradesman of your own choice. In all cases additional local charges will apply.
    </p>
  </div>
   <h6>Q. What happens on the day of delivery?</h6>
  <div>
    <p>
   You will be contacted in advance by a member of our Premier Delivery Service team, who will advise the day we are next delivering to your area. Assuming your goods aren’t self-assembly, we will position the furniture as directed and remove all packaging materials – unless you wish to keep them. Please make sure all access points are clear of obstacles. You should also ensure there is someone in your property to receive and sign for the furniture.
    </p>
  </div>
   <h6>Q. What happens if I am out when you deliver?</h6>
  <div>
    <p>
   As all deliveries need to be signed for, we will be unable to leave your furniture and it will be returned to the distribution centre. Someone will contact you to arrange a further delivery date. There will be an additional extra delivery charge.
    </p>
  </div>
   <h6>Q. Can I nominate a day or time for delivery?</h6>
  <div>
   <p>With limited storage facilities, we endeavour to deliver your order as swiftly as possible, usually no later than 7 days after it becomes available. We would appreciate you accepting delivery on the same basis.</p>
<p>When you order your furniture, we will give you an estimated delivery date. When your goods have been received at our local distribution centre, our Premier Delivery Service team will contact you to confirm the day they deliver to your area. (Please note if you have ordered dining or cabinet furniture which is being delivered directly from our suppliers via their own Premier Direct Home Delivery service, they deliver Monday to Friday only.)</p>
  </div>
   <h6>Q. Can you take my old furniture away?</h6>
  <div>
    <p>
   Yes, in the main we can, for a small additional charge. Provided your delivery address is within 40 miles of your nearest store, and your order is being installed by our own Premier Delivery Team, we can also remove the old furniture you are replacing. To add this service to your order simply check the box.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h6>Q. Can Retail Furniture store my furniture?</h6>
  <div>
    <p>
   Sorry, no. By delivering goods promptly, as soon as we receive them, we can give you the best value for money.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h6>Q. What if my furniture does not fit?</h6>
  <div>
    <p>
   When ordering furniture it is important to check that it will fit into your house and your room. Please check all doors, stairways and the space it has to go into carefully. If the worst happens and it really won’t fit in, we will do our utmost to help you come up with an alternative. E-mail us or phone us nearest branch or showroom for further assistance.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h6>Q. Can I order on Retail Furniture Online and collect from a store?</h6>
  <div>
    <p>
   Yes, the selected distribution centre will contact you on receipt of your order and advise collection times. Details and contact numbers for the relevant distribution centre will be sent to you in an e-mail acknowledgement of your order.
